# Choose an issue to work with

All work should start with a Github Issue. If you would like to contribute to something that is not a Github Issue please create one before working on it. See Additional information for how to create a Github Issue. 

# Plan the design before coding

You can create a wireframe, a mock up, or even draw something with pen and paper but there should be some visual representation of what you are building before you build it. 

# Psuedocode

Write out the logic for what you are building! For example if you are building a dice roll app: 

- The user should be allowed to click a button to roll a die
- On click there should be a visual representation of a die
- We should call a function to randomly pick a number on the die
- Depending on what number is chosen the die will show a certain side 

Pretty basic logical steps so you know what you need to code! You should always get this checked by someone else before moving forward, remember this is a team effort! 

# Set up your environment

Check the getting started guide for downloading the repo. In the games folder add a new folder structured like this:

Folder: Tic Tac Toe
  - TicTacToe.html
  - TicTacToe.css
  - TicTacToe.js
  - image1
  - image2
  - etc
