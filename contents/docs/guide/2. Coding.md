# Editor

You can use any editor of your choice. I use VS Code but you can use anything you are comfortable with. 

# Create a branch named after your issue

Are you coding a Tic Tac To game? Name your branch the name of the game by entering the following in terminal:

```
git checkout -b ticTacToe

```

# Pull often and push often

To get the latest version of the code always use the following before you make any changes:

```
git pull origin master

```

When you need to commit your changes:

```
git add .
git commit -m"description of your change"
git push origin yourbranchname

```

# Merging to Master

To merge your code into the latest Master branch please submit a pull Request. 

- On the Repository click "New Pull Request"
- Make sure the base is set to "Master" and for compare select your branch
- Have someone review your code and approve the pull request but DO NOT MERGE.
- All merges will be done by Rahat after doing a final review of the code. 
- You may be asked to revisit or change some code - do not take this personally we are all here to offere each other constructive criticism and improve our skills. 
- I will also be asking other to review any code I contribute as well.
