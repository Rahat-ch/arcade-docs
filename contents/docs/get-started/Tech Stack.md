# V1 

We will only be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this version. We will not be using any CSS libraries. So no Bootstrap, Bulma etc. Get creative and lets try out some CSS Grid and Flexbox! 

We will only be using vanilla JavaScript. You can begin writing your code in regular ES5 syntax but will need to be converted to ES6 before merging. Please ask Rahat or someone familiar with ES6 once you are done to help you with converting it over. This is so we can get used to using the proper Syntax for eventually building our React app.
