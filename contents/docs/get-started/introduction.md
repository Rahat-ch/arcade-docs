# Rahat Codes Arcade Docs

This is an Open Source Project aimed at helping those newer to web development a chance to work with others in developing a real project. We will be building an arcade site that will go through the following versions:

V1. A simple site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript containing several small games that users can play.

V2. We will refactor V1 into a React application, otherwise the same functionality of V1 will remain in place. 

V3. We will build a backend for the React application (tech stack TBD). Features to be added: User Authentication, Saving and Displaying Scores or Win Counts.
